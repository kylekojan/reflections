When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Allows you to collaborate with others and work on the same projects. They have access to your code and you have access to theirs.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Sometimes you may not be ready to incorporate changes you've made with the master branch and vice versa.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks represent a clone of a repository in github.
You would want to use a fork to be able to commit changes to your own version of someone's repository, allowing you to choose when to push your changes to them.
Clones are used to copy one repository to your local machine.  Branches are to work on multiple versions of code simlutaneously within the same repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
